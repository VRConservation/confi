**Understanding New Models for Accessing Private Investment**

---

## Background
With the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (better known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) in 2021 and the additional resources provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, there has been much attention on federal funding for the nation’s infrastructure. Water systems, including investments to improve drinking water health and security, wastewater and stormwater systems, and natural infrastructure stand to benefit from this infusion of money. However, underneath this apparent largesse lurks a different truth – over 85% of all investments in our communities’ water infrastructure come from local sources - people like you and me paying our taxes and water bills to our local water **utilities**. **(NOTE FROM JO: I tend to use the word "utilities" to refer to actual water or sewer providers, and "agencies" to arms of state or county gov't with non-water or sewer service responsibilities)** Chronically underfunded, these utilities can benefit not just from infusions of public funds from DC and state capitals but from smart, innovative financing strategies that leverage private investments to help public funding work harder.

A parallel news cycle highlighted the increasing appeal of environmental impact bonds and similar outcomes-based approaches to financing water infrastructure. The City of Buffalo just closed on the nation’s largest environmental impact bond, securing 49 million (USD) to help that city overcome flooding and pollution problems with green infrastructure installations on private property.  **(NOTE FROM JO: Actually, the City's bond counsel shot down the investments on private property GSI so AFAIK Buffalo is only doing public prop'y GSI**). In California, Blue Forest Conservation and the Yuba Water Agency recently launched a second Forest Resilience Bond (FRB), delivering another 25 million (USD) to forest and watershed health projects in the Northern Sierra, with additional FRBs in development elsewhere in California, Oregon, and Washington. What makes these approaches compelling? How do they work, and what benefits can they provide? This document hopes to clear up some of the mystery around these and other conservation financing strategies by:

- Clearly describing **collaborative** project finance **(NOTE FROM JO: USE CONSISTENT TERMINOLOGY)**
- Unpacking the roles played by participants in these strategies and the structures that deliver private investment to projects
- Providing examples and lessons learned from existing finance collaborations

## Why Conservation Finance?
Impact investment, outcomes-based financing, private-public partnerships and aggregated funding structures, and other strategies to access private capital are in some ways variations on a time-tested model for accessing the capital needed to fund community infrastructure. Many water utilities have traditionally issued bonds to borrow the money needed to finance sewer systems, water treatment facilities, and other hard infrastructure. Debt-financing these investments has many advantages, including immediate access to the full amount of money needed for projects, reduced upfront costs compared to paying cash for projects, and inter-generational equity that links repayment of the debt to payors who benefit from its services across the project's lifespan. In addition, debt financing may reduce the short-term financial impact on water ratepayers. 

For example, our partners at the WaterNow Alliance point out that if a utility with a 70 million (USD) annual budget were considering investing 10 million (USD) in a major GSI incentive program, the utility would have to raise rates by 14% to pay for the program out of its annual operating budget. If, instead, the utility debt-financed the program and paid for it over 20 years, less than a 1% rate increase would be needed to implement the same $10 million program.[^1] **(NOTE FROM JE: do we want to point out other env'l market activities, such as transportation agencies paying for stream mitigation projects to satisfy Clean Water 404 permits, or landowners getting paid by water utilities to enhance riparian corridors, replenish water supply, or relinquish water rights?)**

## Benefits of Private Finance **(NOTE FROM JE: suggest reframing 'Private Finance' as Debt-Based Finance'; there are other forms of private financing, such as Environmental Market Transactions in the carbon, water, and T&E species spaces that are not discussed here)**
- Matches investment-ready capital with on-the-ground restoration projects that yield environmental and social returns.
- Accelerates the pace and scale at which restoration **(NOTE FROM JO: all preceding text in this section refers to "infrastructure." Need to work in some discussion of restoration for this bullet to be relevant)** work can yield these dual benefits by raising funds upfront and decreasing the time for project completion from decades to 2-3 years.
- Stabilizes otherwise irregular funding from public sources, allowing work to move forward more rapidly and predictably, significantly aiding cash-poor non-profits and municipalities in starting and completing projects.
- Grant and public loan programs are typically paid out to utilities in reimbursements for incurred project costs. Private finance can reduce the financial challenges this creates for water utilities and their partners.
- Builds local capacity and greatly eases the contracting burden across project proponents.
- Can be structured to re-distribute the risk for project design and success away from the payor and toward the implementer (e.g., via a pay-for-performance approach).
- Strengthens project certainty and enables longer-term supply contracts for wood products, which in turn enhances local product markets and stimulates economies
- Financial assurances generate more compelling grant applications

Unlike traditional debt financing, “non-traditional” strategies to access private investment offer some advantages, particularly for smaller and mid-sized water agencies. First, many strategies can transfer risk from the water agency and public to private investors and investment facilitators. What do we mean by this? Initially, approaches such as the partnerships developed by Corvias (now Corvias Infrastructure Partners) placed the responsibility for financing and delivering infrastructure projects on the private sector. Sometimes referred to as private-public partnerships or Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer project delivery, this approach can reduce burdens on water agency staff and open finance opportunities when agencies lack the expertise and capacity to engage private investors directly.

Risk can also be transferred by linking repayment rates to the success of the project; in essence, a water agency is committing to pay for the benefits of a project rather than for the project itself. An interesting example is Bailey’s Trail System Environmental Impact Bond, which is delivering a mountain biking trail network to a rural community in Ohio.[^2] Repayment of this investment isn’t linked to the completion of the trails but to the expected increase in community economic activity in the local community. This economic uplift was the purpose of the project and financing.

Another benefit can come from using private investment to leverage multiple funding sources, creating a portfolio of funds that can repay the initial investment. The North Yuba Forest Resilience Bond is an excellent example of a debt-finance structure that combines state wildfire reimbursable grants, corporate dollars, and water utility payments on the back end to accelerate and scale up watershed health projects by supporting low-interest lending from philanthropic and impact investors on the front end.  Finally, private investment strategies may be accessible for green infrastructure and natural infrastructure projects with limited access to federal and state funding and financing programs, such as State Revolving Loan Funds. Impact investment bonds have successfully delivered green stormwater infrastructure projects in Atlanta and the District of Columbia; the North Yuba Forest Resilience Bond is leveraging multiple investments to deliver forest restoration work across tens of thousands of acres in a fire-threatened California watershed.

## Private Investment in Action
There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to developing a locally relevant private finance strategy, but some key elements appear in many of the pioneering examples in this field. At a most basic level, private finance of water infrastructure requires relationships between _stakeholders_ or _beneficiaries_ who can participate in the planning and initiation of
projects. These beneficiaries also may be _investors_ in the project; however, _investors_ may be an entirely separate set of entities.

Ultimately, the central role is played by the agency or agencies who are the primary payors for the project. **(NOTE FROM JE: I would argue that the central role is played by the project developer structuring these kinds of deals. They are the ones coordinating between Investor, Beneficiary/Payor, Land Manager, Implementer, and Researcher-if applicable)** These agency payors are responsible for repaying all debt, including any interest on borrowed money. _Payors_ may be able to draw upon rate or tax revenues and other sources of income to repay the _investors_. In the water sector, payors may be motivated by the need to comply with regulations or other legal mandates, the obsolescence of outdated infrastructure, or the need to respond to emerging conditions or threats. For community groups or other non-agency proponents of a project, establishing a partnership with a payor is instrumental to the success of most financed projects. Industry groups and corporations may also be motivated to meet internal environmental commitments, or reduce supply chain risks associated with water or other natural hazards.

Let’s take these roles in turn.

**Collaboratives and Implementers**. Often, successfully planned, financed, and implemented projects succeed because they are informed and supported by a collaboration of affected beneficiaries or stakeholders. These individuals and organizations can ground a project in the surrounding community's needs, contribute expertise and perspectives that inform project design and implementation, and contribute social capital that leads to political support for the project. This support can translate into opened opportunities for funding, investment, and other forms of support. Financially solvent organizations that can absorb financing, administer contracts, and partner with natural resource agencies are critical intermediaries for delivering projects successfully.

**Investors or Lenders**. For public financing programs, federal or state agencies may capitalize projects or borrowers in the form of low-interest loans, credit guarantees, credit enhancement or loss reserves, or technical assistance. For debt issuances on the private market, investors can come from many sectors. For instance, insurance companies, retirement funds, university endowments, and institutional investors may offer below-market interest rates if a project meets its
environmental or social benefit goals. Individual impact investors, acting alone or through composite funds, may be willing to provide capital at reduced rates of return to environmentally or socially beneficial projects. Finally, philanthropic foundations may be available to invest in projects that fulfill their programmatic interests. One benefit of private finance strategies is the potential to blend multiple investment sources into one project portfolio, perhaps even sequencing these sources of financing to discrete phases of a project.

**Payors**. Ultimately, projects must be paid for, and lenders repaid for the financing they provide. This repayment obligation will often fall on a public water agency or other governmental body with an operational or ownership interest in the proposed project. Agencies with a regulatory or other driver that compels their interest in the benefits of a project will be the most ‘secure’ payors. However, other forces may motivate agencies, institutions, and even businesses to pay for (or contribute toward) the outcomes associated with a successful project.
Corporations with sustainability, resilience, or environmental justice commitments are equally driven to invest in projects that provide beneficial outcomes. Economic development agencies and entities may have funding to contribute to projects that meet local job creation or business engagement goals.
In communities without the financial resources to repay financing on their own, public subsidization will remain a necessary part of closing the funding gap. Project developers and public agencies should be mindful of opportunities to secure reimbursable grants and other programmatic funds that can be used to defray other beneficiary contributions and further compel private investment.

Combining all these actors into a financing package keyed to a natural infrastructure project may be less straightforward than the pathway to traditional bond issuance and is certainly more complicated than simple cash pay-go approaches to capital improvements. Where simpler approaches to investing in infrastructure are available, it’s likely best for an agency to pursue those avenues. However, private finance can unstick projects long deferred in waiting for traditional finance opportunities or capital improvement budgets to provide enough cash. Private finance can also deliver projects that are larger in scale and have beneficial outcomes than can be supported with annual grants or budget cycles. It can be useful to look at the financing structures adopted by existing private investment models to understand better the interplay between investors, payors, and beneficiaries.

In 2017, Quantified Ventures and the District of Columbia’s Department of Water and Sewer (DC Water) launched the nation’s first environmental impact bond focused on implementing green infrastructure to reduce sewage overflows and flooding.[^3] This outcomes-based investment package tied the rate investors earned to achieving specified environmental performance goals. The investment package structure linked DC Waterto private bond buyers. The structure used by Quantified Ventures, DC Water, and their investors follows the track illustrated below. Noteworthy in this outcomes-based repayment scheme is the role of the third-party evaluator. Five years after launching the project, the evaluator confirmed that stormwater runoff had been reduced by nearly 20%, a level that met the bond’s base-level repayment criteria.[^4]

Blue Forest's Forest Resilience Bond adopts a somewhat different approach. The Bond, more of a revolving loan instrument, is not strictly an outcomes-based financing strategy. The project payor, Yuba Water Agency, makes payments to investors that are not linked to achieving any of the project’s many benefits. The structure adopted by Blue Forest enables the creation of a portfolio of investors and funders who repay and complement the Agency’s funding.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uNOuEG3.png)

In the above diagram, the investors (Calvert Impact Capital, AAA Insurance, and others) provide up-front capital by paying into the Forest Resilience Bond. This aggregate fund, administered by the National Forest Foundation, pays contractors and local NGOs to plan and deliver forest and watershed restoration activities. Once completed, Yuba Water Agency (the beneficiary) repays implementation costs to the fund, which repays the investors.

## Additional Case Studies
In addition to the three examples mentioned above, other experiences with innovative private financing showcase the flexibility and appeal of these strategies. **(NOTE FROM JE: again, do we want to highlight environmental market transactions as well as debt-based financing?)**

```{admonition} Corvias
Corvias, a leading developer of private-public partnerships, built on its success in Prince George’s County, MD, with the Fresh Coast Protection Program launch with the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. Through this program, the partnership secured $75 million in financing, providing resources enabling Corvias to design and construct green infrastructure projects to help MMSD meet its regulatory goals. The outcomes-based partnership commits the District to pay a fixed cost per gallon to Corvias, with the ultimate target of installing 8.45 million gallons of stormwater retention capacity.
```

These examples show the possibilities and benefits of creative strategies that bring private capital to support water infrastructure projects.[^6] Nevertheless, there are exceptions to the normal pathways that water agencies and municipal governments take to finance such projects. There are some challenges to securing private finance that have stymied broader acceptance of this approach – and more effort is needed to understand and reduce the impact of these obstacles. Institutions like the Conservation Finance Network are commendable resources for
cultivating knowledge about financing, highlighting best practices, and sharing notable experiences with a wide audience.

```{admonition} EIFDs
Several municipalities in California pioneered Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts to leverage the value of infrastructure improvements as collateral for obtaining the resources to implement these projects.[^5] Using tax increment financing, this approach allows water agencies and municipal governments to issue bond debt for projects that future increases in property tax revenue will repay.
```

This is not to say that pursuing these approaches to private finance is challenge-free. Some of the costs and challenges will be familiar to public utilities with experience with bond preparation and issuance for capital projects. Considering outcomes-based finance or similar approaches adds some new issues: lack of familiarity and capacity, uncertainty about how to measure outcomes best, and lack of established networks between utilities and investors, to name but a few. The authors of this paper discuss significant impediments and pathways to reduce them in a separate issue brief.
