# Introduction
Welcome to this Conservation Finance e-Book. Several articles in this book and the underlying pilot project were originally supported by a 2022 California Department of Water Resources, Integrated Regional Water Management, and Disadvantaged Community Involvement Technical Assistance grant to the Yuba Water Agency. The resources created under that grant provided a foundation for additional collaboration between the authors of this e-book and for further developing conservation finance strategies in project areas across Northern California. Please see the initial report, [Because It's Worth It](http://gg.gg/1aut0n), for an additional complement to this resource.

To build on this effort, we updated and edited several original articles and added new chapters with additional collaborators from The Freshwater Trust, Blue Forest, and the National Forest Foundation. We hope to add new chapters, cases, and success stories as conservation evolves.

## Conservation Finance
Whether in the form of grants or capital budget allocations, public agency funding often fluctuates dramatically with political and financial currents. This long-term unpredictability often motivates businesses, nonprofits, and agencies to seek sustainable funding models and approaches to leverage public and private investments in natural resource conservation and infrastructure.

Conservation finance offers an emerging approach to securing long-term, predictable finance for landscape-scale conservation and forest health projects. Conservation finance also fosters effective collaboration between private and public sectors, creating stakeholders and investors from the pool of project beneficiaries. This innovative strategy achieves multiple goals:

Channels capital into conservation projects that offer overlapping triple-bottom-line (ecological, social, and financial) outcomes.
- Attracts private investment by quantifying ecosystem services to create a value proposition for beneficiaries, who will pay for these benefits.
- Utilizes partnerships to strengthen the financial foundation for watershed restoration, reforestation, and post-fire recovery.
- Reduces the burden on public budgets and stabilizes irregular funding sources.
- Increases the pace and scale at which these initiatives are completed.
- Enables the long-term protection of forests and related natural resources, ensuring their invaluable benefits persist for future generations.

Many other organizations specializing in or creating conservation finance programs and opportunities are cited throughout the book. 

## Why this book?
Conservation finance strategies and case studies are well described across the professional and academic press. However, in many cases, this information is either tailored to an audience with previous finance expertise or is captured in disparate articles and websites that do not provide a single point of reference. This web-accessible book is intended to serve as a concise yet comprehensive introduction to conservation finance. It is particularly intended for an audience of land managers, public agencies, nonprofits, and other individuals without specific expertise in project finance.

Whereas other publications and the focus of impact finance focus on social investment and infrastructure, this book focuses on examples and cases of natural resource management, forest health, and watershed restoration.
