## Takeaways
For the TL;DR folks:
- **New approach/sustainable funding**. Conservation finance is a relatively new approach to funding conservation projects to create more sustainable funding revenue at scale.
- **Public-private partnerships**. One pathway to increasing funding sustainability is to leverage public funds with private investment.
- **Challenges**. Although there are many successful examples, conservation finance has yet to scale due to innovation curves, resistance to new approaches, and bespoke solutions in each landscape where it's applied.

## Background
It is impossible to ignore that our natural systems cannot withstand the fast-accelerating threats posed by climate change. These systems—which have long provided us clean air, clean water, flood protection, and beautiful places to recreate—need our help, and they need a lot more of it yesterday. In the face of these urgent climate-driven pressures, we must rapidly deliver natural infrastructure project dollars to protect biodiversity, thin forests, reintroduce fire as an ecosystem process, implement better water use technology on farms, and improve habitat in streams and wetlands. However, the current funding, financing, and implementation infrastructure isn’t in place to make this happen.
 
With a clear-eyed view of these realities, we cannot simply hope that if we just try harder within the structures of our conservation system, we’ll magically get bigger, faster, and better results. Instead of accepting good projects here and there as the best we can do, we must set quantifiable targets, intentionally organize our funding, tools, and partners around delivering the projects that can best achieve those targets, and harness the power of finance and capital to catapult projects forward. Simply put, we need a system capable of adding one or two more zeros worth of project areas (and funds supporting them) in each watershed, or we’ll never catch up.
 
This incentive- and data-driven approach can deliver leveraged funding to the best projects with much greater speed and efficiency and provide us with something we’ve been sorely missing: a viable pathway to achieving our long-term objectives.
 
In this book, you’ll see exciting examples of how several innovators have taken this challenge head-on. These realist idealists have worked to fit countless square pegs into round holes. Looking forward, it’s time to build from these lessons and collectively implement the best lessons into our conservation funding system so that we graduate from pilots and one-offs into widespread progress toward resilience.

## Threats
The deepening implications of global climate change are increasingly apparent in both emerging ecological trends and increasing social and economic disruptions. The combinations of drought and extreme heat are accelerating the planet's frequency, scale, and intensity of wildfires. Diminished by drought and shifting precipitation patterns, water supplies in many regions are increasingly challenged to meet human and ecological needs. Habitat degradation or conversion, roads built into natural areas, and illegal wildlife trade combine with climate change to threaten biodiversity.

At the same time, storm pattern fluctuations generate floods that stretch or overwhelm existing flood management infrastructure and threaten human and natural communities. Responding to these and other challenges requires local, regional, and national intervention. It also requires innovation in the funding, financing, and governance strategies that the public and private sectors must use to plan, develop, and deploy climate resilience strategies.

## Nature-based solutions
In the face of these urgent climate-driven pressures, we must rapidly deliver natural infrastructure project dollars to thin forests, implement better water use technology on farms, and improve habitat in streams and wetlands. However, the current funding, financing, and implementation infrastructure isn’t in place to make this happen.

**Problem**
The traditional, project-by-project, partner-by-partner approach to funding and implementing conservation and restoration work is not capable of delivering watershed-scale resilience at the pace or scale necessary to adapt to the multiple impacts of climate change. In the current system, funds are split between multiple agency programs with complex fund matching and eligibility requirements; large landscapes are broken into siloed jurisdictional implementation efforts; and local
stakeholder groups are left in the middle trying to piece together funds to implement a fraction of the needed projects. The urgency of climate change demands that we more rapidly secure, prioritize, and deploy much more funding. Doing that will require a replicable partnership and leveraged co-funding structure.

**Solution**
A Watershed Outcomes Bank (WOB) framework is a response to all these practical challenges. Watershed-scale resilience can be achieved by leveraging together siloed funding sources, targeting those coordinated funds to high-impact projects across a watershed, simplifying and making more certain the delivery of those funds to partners, and linking together projects throughout a watershed across isolated land management units.

**Framework**
1. Quantifies regional watershed/landscape resilience targets.
2. Quantifies potential watershed resilience project benefits or values from a variety of project types that can generate those
benefits (e.g., forest thinning, irrigation upgrades, agricultural land repurposing leading to water replenishment, carbon sequestration, and economic uplift).
3.

Despite their importance, projects intended to protect our communities and ecosystems are routinely and significantly underfunded until the inevitable disasters occur. As a result, taxpayers are often left to shoulder the relatively increased costs of reactive actions to respond to crises. Similarly, traditional approaches to community infrastructure, e.g., water supply systems, flood and stormwater management, and natural resource management, often need to be more suited to providing resilience in a changing climate. An alternative and more cost-effective approach favors up-front investments in actions that use natural processes to increase ecosystem and community resilience to climate change impacts.

## Status quo
With an honest view of these realities, we cannot simply hope that if we try harder within our conservation system, we’ll magically get bigger, faster, better results. Instead of accepting good projects here and there as the best we can do, we must set quantifiable targets, intentionally organize our funding, tools, and partners around delivering the projects that can best achieve those targets, and harness the power of finance and capitalism to catapult us forward. Simply put, we need a system capable of adding more money to projects in each watershed.

## Scale
During the past decade, there has been unprecedented federal and state investment in forest health and restoration projects. Despite the compelling need and benefits, private investment has yet to match public investments. Scaling conservation finance is also impeded by bespoke, often hyper-local funding that is difficult to replicate at larger scales. The newness of the funding mechanism may be at play here. Still, the needed collaboration to create a conservation finance mechanism takes time to build trust and broach skepticism during implementation. Getting beyond business as usual, especially with risk-averse local organizations, is critical to increasing uptake curves and broadly scaling conservation finance. Multiple examples can further aid scaling acceleration, and private investors can gain confidence in their value with clear, measurable outcomes.

Nature-based solutions may be one key way to scale investment in biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation solutions. Still, the scale and time mismatch between bespoke finance solutions and the need for rapid climate change mitigation or ecosystem restoration is a major challenge facing conservation practitioners.

## Solutions
An incentive- and data-driven approach can deliver leveraged funding to the best projects with much greater speed and simplicity and provide us with something we’ve been sorely missing: a viable pathway to achieving our long-hoped-for objectives. In this book, you’ll see exciting examples of how several innovators have taken this challenge head-on. These realist idealists have worked to fit countless square pegs into round holes. Looking forward, it’s time to build from these lessons and collectively implement the best lessons into our conservation funding system so that we graduate from pilots and one-offs into widespread resilience.

The following are suggested solutions for the private sector, government, communities, and non-profits:

### Private Sector
- Develop a marketplace to connect private investors, payors, and project implementers.
- Encourage other private sector investors and payors to contribute to conservation finance projects, particularly where there’s a connection between investment and avoided costs. For example, a water purveyor becomes a payor for projects reducing wildfire risk in a watershed with hydropower facilities.
- Develop viable marketplaces for resources other than carbon, such as water, biodiversity, air quality, and other valued public resources.

### Government
- Examine and implement ways to reduce the red tape associated with permitting and compliance, especially for white-hat restoration projects incorporating conservation finance.
- Fund projects that consider and budget for scale and replication across larger landscapes.
- Collaborate with private sector and non-profits to identify and eliminate perverse incentives that hinder conservation efforts.

### Communities & Non-profits
- Connect with organizations and communities implementing conservation finance mechanisms to understand the benefits, challenges, and lessons learned.
- For organizations developing conservation finance mechanisms, create clear and honest lessons learned communications guidance for non-profits, government, and the private sector. Work to make connections between projects and funders.
- Look for ways to create a rising tide that floats all boats, where many nonprofits compete for the same funds. Would creating a larger funding pot fund all organizations rather than create competition that costs time and capacity? Are there complementary skills that can be identified and shared? 
- Measure project outcomes. Register what works in the conservation evidence database.
- Create an outcomes bank (example from Cosumnes).

## Next steps
The future of conservation finance centers around fostering collaboration between governments, private sectors, and non-profits to streamline funding for large-scale, replicable restoration projects. Decreasing the connection time between investors and project proponents is critical to the long-term success of leveraging public and private funds. Creating automated landscape measurement systems that accurately measure project outcomes will increase trust in new finance and create a larger marketplace for investment and implementation. Conservation cannot leave its adolescent phase without considering connections, scale, and replication. Innovative financing models should support vital conservation efforts and offer promise for sustainable investment for contributions to the planet's health and resilience.
