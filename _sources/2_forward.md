Towards a new finance model for landscape restoration

## Takeaways
- **New approach/sustainable funding**. Conservation finance is a relatively new approach to funding conservation projects with the ultimate goal of creating more sustainable funding revenue at scale. The amount of conservation funding consistently made available does not exceed the supply of projects needed to generate resilient outcomes.
- **Public private partnerships**. One pathway to increasing funding sustainability is leverage public funds with private investment.
- **Challenges**. Although there are many successful examples, conservation finance has not yet scaled due to factors such as innovation curves, resistance to new approaches, issues related to project aggregation at the scale necessary to generate landscape outcomes and attract investment, public funding restrictions, and bespoke solutions in each landscape where it's applied, among others. 

## Threats
It is increasingly impossible to ignore that our natural systems cannot withstand the fast-accelerating threats posed by climate change. These systems—which have long provided us clean air, clean water, flood protection, and beautiful places to recreate—need our help and they need a lot more of it, yesterday.

The deepening implications of global climate change are increasingly apparent in both emerging ecological trends and increasing social and economic disruptions.  The combinations of drought and extreme heat are accelerating the frequency, scale, and intensity of wildfires across the planet. Diminished by drought and shifting precipitation patterns, water supplies in many regions are increasingly challenged to meet human and ecological needs. At the same time, fluctuations in storm patterns are generating floods that stretch or overwhelm existing flood management infrastructure. Responding to these, and other, challenges requires intervention at local, regional, and national scales.  It requires coordination across traditionally disparate public agencies serving separate but interrelated functions. It also requires innovation in the funding, financing, and governance strategies that the public and private sectors must use to plan, develop, and deploy climate resilience strategies.

## Nature-based solutions
In the face of these urgent climate-driven pressures, we must rapidly deliver natural infrastructure project dollars to thin forests, improve and adapt our transportation networks, implement better water use technology on farms, and improve habitat in streams and wetlands. But the current funding, financing, and implementation infrastructure isn’t in place to make this happen.

Despite their importance, projects intended to protect our communities and ecosystems are routinely and significantly underfunded until an inevitable disasters occurs. As a result, taxpayers are often left to shoulder the (relatively) increased costs of reactive actions to respond to crises. Similarly, traditional approaches to community infrastructure (e.g., water supply systems, flood and stormwater management) and natural resource management are often ill-suited to providing resilience in a changing climate. An alternative and more cost-effectie approach favors up-front investments in actions that use natural processes to increase ecosystem and community resilience to climate change impacts. 

## Status quo
With a clear-eyed view of these realities, we cannot simply hope that if we just try harder within the conservation system we operate in that we’ll magically get bigger, faster, better results. Many organizations are competing for the same funding and even project sites, often without coordinating or leveraging workforce capacity, equipment, funding, and environmental compliance capabilities. Instead of accepting good projects here and there as the best we can do, we must set quantifiable targets, intentionally organize our funding, tools, and partners around delivering the projects that can best achieve those targets, and harness the power of finance and capitalism to catapult us forward. Simply put, we need a system capable of adding 1-2 zeros more money to projects in each watershed.

## Scale
From Build Back Better to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, the years 2020 through 2024 have resulted in an unprecedented influx of federal and state investment in both physical and natural infrastructure. Natural resource agencies have been challenges to transition from an operating environment of deficit to one of surplus, strategically targeting larger landscapes with compelling investment opportunities that can be administered at a scale that attracts and leverages private investment. Not only are local communities and burgeoning public-private partnerships seeking solutions, but there is an implicit recognition that we must become more transparent in sharing these lessons learned to enable replication where the conditions are most suitable. The long-term ability for land managers to absorb and allocate funding and financing is dependent upon our ability to build more robust local partnerships, imbued with the authority to flexibility administer and collectively make decisions about which projects should be implemented and by whom. We must empower these local partners to navigate these financial complexities, clearly delineating roles and responsibilities, and develop new tools to quantify project outcomes to the beneficiaries that matter. In addition to funding the projects that matter, targeted financing can help build reassurances necessary for traditional funders to invest in the supporting project infrastructure necessary to enable further planning and development, from environmental analysis to workforce development and new market stimulation. In the end, we hope to secure a more virtuous cycle where enhanced public subsidies can enable the private sector to target its efforts on the types of implementation activities necessary to deliver these outcomes at scale.

## Solutions
This incentive- and data-driven approach can deliver leveraged funding to the best projects with much greater speed and simplicity, and provide us something we’ve been sorely missing: a viable pathway to achieving our long hoped-for objectives.

In this book, you’ll see exciting examples of how several innovators have taken this challenge head-on. These “realist idealists” have worked to fit countless square pegs into round holes. Looking forward, it’s time to build from these lessons and collectively implement the best lessons into our conservation funding system so that we graduate from pilots and one-offs into the widespread resilience.

## Additional points/notes
- What happens when funds avail themselves? We’ve seen an unprecedented federal investment over the past five years, yet relatively little coordination outside of specific programs and instances
- What does the private sector need to do? What do communities need to do? What do governments need to do? What do NGOs need to do?
- Environmental impact finance bonds have been proposed and implemented to leverage private funds with public dollars. 
- Market-based incentives and solutions.
- Outcomes bank. Promise and reality
- Ecotrust models with ownership of assets and selling outputs
- Many approaches work (cf. [conservation evidence database and journal](https://www.conservationevidence.com/)).
- Perverse incentives and policies hinder or destroy conservation/restoration efforts.
- Scale mismatch between landscape need vs. project level implementation (and funding).
- Connecting funders to project implementers is difficult, arduous, or takes too long.
- Environmental pathways for white flag projects are lengthy and take funding away from implementation.
